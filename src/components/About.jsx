    <p>
      I'm a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in front-end web development. I genuinely enjoy building responsive and user-friendly websites, and I often spend time exploring tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to bring ideas to life. Whether it’s designing a clean interface or figuring out how to make a layout work across all screen sizes, I like the challenge of turning a concept into something real and usable."Outside of coding, I enjoy reading about UI trends and occasionally try replicating interfaces from products I use."
      Lately, I’ve been working on projects that help me understand not just how websites look, but how they feel to use — focusing on accessibility, animation, and performance. I believe in writing clean, reusable code and I’m always open to learning new technologies that can make my work better. I’m now looking for opportunities where I can keep improving, learn from real-world development teams, and contribute to meaningful projects.
